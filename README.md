**This project was submitted as a final project for CS50x 2020. Reuse of this work is not permitted.**

This web application allows the user to input any number of genes, as well as dominant and recessive traits for each gene along with a symbol they would like to represent the allele.  
After the user selects the parents' genotypes, they can choose to calculate all possible offspring's genotypes and phenotypes or to calculate for an offspring with a specific phenotype.  
They are then able to select the genotype of one child from the current generation to be a parent in the next, at which point they also select the genotypes of the other parent for each trait.  
This generational process can be repeated indefinitely.

This application does not account for nuances in the inheritance of genes. It also does not account for the possibility of a child having a phenotype that is not possible for the parents' genotypes. This application was created with a highschool-level understanding of genetics and does not fully represent the complexities of the subject.
