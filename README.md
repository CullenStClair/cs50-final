CS50 final project: DNA traits selection and inheritance estimation.

This web application allows the user to input any number of genes that is 2 or higher.<br>The user then inputs the dominant and recessive traits for each gene as well as the symbol they would like to represent the allele.<br>After the user selects the parents' genotypes using dropdowns they can choose to calculate all possible offspring's genotypes and phenotypes or to calculate for an offspring with a specific phenotype through dropdown fields.<br>They are then able to select the genotype of one child from the current generation to be a parent in the next, at which point they also select the genotypes of the other parent for each trait.<br>This generational process can be repeated indefinetely.
